Hi! This is Sumitro.

The main reason this blog exists is that Iâ€™m a lazy person and I want others to also to be as lazy as me. I will update this blog with technical stuff mostly, especially those tasks which are frequently required to be done. I try to write the blog posts in such a way so that you only have to follow the posts to the point without too many assumptions.

Currently, I'm doing a PhD at IIT Kharagpur in Computer Science and Engineering.
You can know more about me in my academic website [here][1]

You can contact me by using the icons on the _Sidebar_.
