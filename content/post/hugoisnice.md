This is my first post in this site (Technically)

Since I am not _the sharpest tool in the shed_, I needed to try out Hugo for an entire afternoon to make it work properly.

I had some difficulty in understanding how to setup the custom themes. Then I had the _brilliant_ idea of moving the `theme.toml` file to the Hugo directory and lo, the site was created properly!

This theme that I'm using is called [Hyde-y][1], which is extremely clean, Material-designed, and hopefully responsive.

If you want to start your own blog site quickly, I would suggest you to try out Hugo.

If you have less patience, then I would point you to another static site generator, [mkdocs][2],  which is easy as water
